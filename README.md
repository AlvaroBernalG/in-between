[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlvaroBernalG/in-between.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlvaroBernalG/in-between) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/in-between.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/in-between) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

Augmented version of [in-range](https://github.com/sindresorhus/in-range) made by [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com) with a more functional taste. 
## Install
```
$ npm install in-between
```


## Usage 
With numbers: 

```js
const between = require('in-between')

const between1and10 = between(1, 10)

between1and10(10) //=> false

between1and10(3) //=> true

betweenAandZ('*') //=> throws error

between1and10(1) //=> false

between(100, 200)(101) //=> true

```

Works with alphabet characters: 

```js

const between = require('in-between')

const betweenAandD = between('a', 'd')

betweenAandD('b') //=> true

betweenAandD('z') //=> false

```

Works with Dates as well:

```js

const between = require('in-between')

let myGraduation = new Date("October 13, 2014 11:13:00")

let myFirstJob =  new Date("September 1, 2015 11:13:00")

let myBirthDay =  new Date("January 10, 2015 10:11:03")

between(myGraduation, myFirstJob)(myBirthDay) //=> true

```

You can also include boundaries:

```js

const between = require('in-between')

between(3, 4, true)(3) //=> true

between('a', 'b', true)('a') // => true


```
