## Install
```
$ npm install in-between
```


## Usage

```js
const between = require('in-between')

const between1and10 = between(1, 10)

const betweenAandZ = between('a', 'z')

between1and10(10) //=> true

betweenAandZ('b') //=> true

between1and10(-1) //=> false

betweenAandZ('*') //=> throws error

between1and10(1) //=> true

between(100, 200)(10) //=> false

```

Works with Dates as well

let first = new Date()

let target =  new Date()

let last =  new Date()

between(first, last)(middle) //=> true

```
